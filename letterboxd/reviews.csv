2021-07-17,Happiness,1998,https://boxd.it/202rPF,3,,"I‚Äôm gonna be blending both of the reactions I had for this movie: agreeing this to be one of the best dark comedies out there and the other believing it to be too twisted and cynical to be classified as something for entertainment purposes.

<blockquote>Honestly, I was so uncomfortable¬†watching this movie and I think the main reason is because of how real it felt: the family felt real, the events were tragic but definitely based on reality, and how these situations and characters could be present in your own life without you knowing.¬†</blockquote>Was I satisfied with the movie as a whole? Yes, I think. None of the scenes seemed out of place and for the runtime being more than two hours, that is kind of cool.¬†

<b>NOTE</b>: The scene before the title sequence is probably the best way to capture how the rest of the movie will pan out: starting innocently enough until the shift comes where suddenly the whole thing turns to üí©.","dark comedy, philip seymour hoffman",2021-07-16
2021-07-17,The Devil Wears Prada,2006,https://boxd.it/203Dyt,4.5,,"Both Emily from Emily in Paris and Andy from Devil Wears Prada are at the same level of oblivious when it comes to their job, but Andy is just more charismatic about it.

Something that caught most of my attention for the film was the progression of Andy's outfits and how well put together all the outfits were for the characters. It made the Runway Fashion environment much more believable and the scenes held much more power like when Miranda gives Andy that spiel about that cerulean blue sweater (Andy at the beginning of the movie definitely gave ""not like other girls"" energy). The whole movie just felt very believable and that's all I ask for.

I've seen better plot twists in other movies but since I felt connected to all the characters involved, this one had me feel equally as betrayed.

2021-07-20,10 Cloverfield Lane,2016,https://boxd.it/20xRZj,4.5,,"I was not ready for the Cloverfield universe and don‚Äôt think I ever will be.

<blockquote>
First thing I noticed was how much character and details the set had (which is very important considering we are in one place for most of the movie and IMO the reason why <i>Split</i> and <i>The Room</i> wasn‚Äôt as good as it could have been but then again they have diff goals with their sets). And with all the little details on set, the movie makes sure to make a call back to all the little things like a picture frame, utensils, and even a board game. I wonder if the attention to detail is the director‚Äôs input and why he is so famous.</blockquote>
No one would be able to guess the ending of this movie and it‚Äôs just something you have to go blind to (like I did). The only reason why it‚Äôs not 5 stars is because of one specific scene, but I won‚Äôt spoil.

I‚Äôm reading the reviews on here and there‚Äôs a lot of praise for John Goodman or ‚Äúthe creepy bunker guy.‚Äù I personally did find myself being scared of the unpredictability of his character and had me physically cringe at some of the things he did. I‚Äôm not really someone that knows a lot about acting but maybe I‚Äôll watch some more movies he stars in.","john goodman, dan trachtenberg",2021-07-19
2021-07-21,Sound of Metal,2019,https://boxd.it/20HbrJ,2.5,,"I can't say that this movie really amazed me or even was worth my time. However, I can still appreciate it for what it is even if the story was a little bland for my liking‚Äî a tough, apathetic guy is given some burden where he has to hang out with outcasts only to then self-reflect on who he formerly was and can now mature into the best version of himself. Sounds like A Walk to Remember but instead of Mandy Moore it‚Äôs a little deaf schoolboy?

It felt predictable all the way through and nothing in this movie had me go ""wow, good on them for changing the narrative in a way I couldn't expect"" so that is why this gets a not-so-high but earnest rating. 

What did I like about this movie: the scene where Ruben has to cut ties with the deaf house is the best scene because it shows the climax of Ruben's selfishness and I'm glad Joe put him in his place. I think it's good that we didn't have to see him saying goodbye to anyone when he left cause I don't think he deserved a proper farewell anyway from the housemates.",,2021-07-21
2021-07-22,(500) Days of Summer,2009,https://boxd.it/20LBux,4.5,,"Probably my favorite opening for any movie just because of the song that plays in the background during the montage. 

It's easy to hate Tom because of how down bad he is for Summer especially in the earlier days, but what this movie does well is portraying how humans are complicated and all Tom was doing was learning that the many people that come in and out of your life may only b lessons rather than your soulmates.","zooey deschanel, joseph gordon-levitt",2021-07-21

2021-07-29,Little Miss Sunshine,2006,https://boxd.it/21PE61,4,,"This is the best family coming-of-age movie I've watched and I saw Minari. 

One thing that prevents this from being a 5/5 is there wasn't enough attention on the mom; mom definitely had issues just like the rest of them but wasn't given enough screentime to air out her dirty laundry on what those were.

It's not until the closing scene came that I realized how attached I was to the Hoover family. After watching them drive 800+ miles, you start to feel like you're in that car as well.

This film reminds me of what it was like watching Fight Club, and I really thought this was directed by David Fincher (random details that are overlooked until they come together in the end, meta dialogue, how some scenes r shot). If Christopher Nolan is anything like David Fincher, then I should probably look more into his work.

The time jumps and the a-ha! moments were not as fleshed out as I think they could have been, probably because the film is so short. ",christopher nolan,2021-08-09
2021-08-11,Fish Tank,2009,https://boxd.it/23IMOJ,3,,"This was OKAY, I've watched better coming-of-age movies and don't think this is one I'd recommend.

But this movie felt very real from the amateur dancing that looked like it was learned from London street dancing videos to dialogue between toxic, hot-headed family members. I was rooting for Mia for most of the movie and thought she made a good protagonist. 

Is it called fish tank cause she feels constrained in the town she's living in and that's why she leaves to Wales? Is it cause she's a fish out of water? But then why not name it a fish bowl? Is she ACTUALLY the fish, what if it's Connor or her mom or sister?

I'm not usually a person that notices great acting and don't even have a favorite actor that comes to mind, but the characters here were so unbelievably annoying that it was hard to step back and realize that this wasn't a real family I was spying on. 

Noah Baumbach creating this AND marriage story is crazy and it goes to show how introspective his story telling is. 

I personally would have liked the squid and the whale metaphor to be a little more fleshed out just because I believe that the rest of the movie was SO good that the reference at the end was a little malnourished? Lacking.","jesse eisenberg, noah baumbach, hotdog3",2021-09-21

2021-11-25,Kids,1995,https://boxd.it/2jjvnl,0.5,,"Literal shit is what this movie is. I thought I hated Harmony Korine after watching half of Gummo and now can say that I definitely hate at least one of his movies in full length. 

Watching this did not feel like a 'scope into the lives of NY street kids' but more like 'how am I going to root for Jennie for the whole movie and nothing but BAD things are going to happen to her???' Any hope that you have for this movie DIES. 

How is it that this is movie supposed to be a conversation about teenage unprotected sex and HIV when our antagonist is getting more screentime for his dumb sex escapades than our protagonist??? Face it: Larry Clark was more interested in filming Telly getting it on with a 13-year-old girl than any lesson that Jennie was trying to learn from all this.

The only interesting scene here was the girls vs guys sex talk, after that is just prepubescent porn and major sexual assault cases happening. Things that are disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing is all Harmony Korine is good for. 

The ethics in this movie are also quite concerning since Casper did some major method acting in this film (someone who was never a real actor to begin with and literally lived this story) While Casper or Justin Pierce has full autonomy of his actions and no one else, it makes watching this just so uncomfortable and people that enjoyed this movie questionable.","harmony korine, chloe sevigny",2021-11-24

The premise was so lost within this movie (girls going to the dark side in order to continue partying and ignoring their wasted life + potential) because I thought I‚Äôd see the most character development and story in here, but all it did was let me down. 

Way too many threesome scenes to actually keep the story going, what a shameless wanker that Korine is.

This is one of Korine‚Äôs least fan‚Äôs favorite movies but after watching his fan‚Äôs most favorite (KIDS), I think they only hated this movie cause it didn‚Äôt have enough ambiguous empty space for them to interpret whatever crap they wanted to take away from it.¬†This movie really just spells everything out for you, one of the most brain-dead scripts ever like how many times can they say ‚Äúmother fucker‚Äù before I start believing it‚Äôs not a real word.

2021-11-27,Gummo,1997,https://boxd.it/2jAPM5,1,,"The ending was kinda beautiful (minus the dead cat), I liked the ending song. 

This film was less harmful than Kids and more interesting than Spring Breakers, so sure! this one is probably the best one that I like out of Harmony Korine's set even though I definitely spaced out after the 1-hour mark. 

Repetitive, boring scenes. The thing is that the dialogue doesn't match up with whatever message Korine is trying to send, therefore I can never find anything deep within Korine's movies/films. Just because you get white people to use the n-word and film it on a kodak camera doesn't mean that it ""so raw and authentic and genuine."" Alas, for someone that was clearly spiraling behind the scenes with his own issues.. this is a fine end result. 

The only scenes that evoked any emotion in me were the sisters defending their other sister from the old pervert in the car and the spaghetti bathtub scene (when his crunch bar fell in that bathtub, I wanted to end my life right there).","chloe sevigny, harmony korine",2021-11-26

Just based on their looks it was a really good cast selection, I like how PTA didn‚Äôt find stunning people that would distract the audience from how messed up these characters really are.¬†

The girl is hopeless and trying to chase back her youth because she‚Äôs sad about how much of a loser she has become while the kid has everything going for him and his only real setback is that he is only 15. The power imbalance at face value is the woman being 25 and the boy being 15. As you keep watching, you start to realize this isn‚Äôt your typical 15 year old and not a fully grown 25 year old. You see how the woman is lost in who she is and that she actually <i>relies</i>¬†on the kid which is pretty sad and once he starts realizing that too, the roles start to shift (or were they ever shifted in the first place?)","pta, alana haim, cooper hoffman, theatre, hotdog3",2021-12-30

The movie is tragic then beautiful then hopeless then hopeful. I LOVE THE SQUARE RATIO ASPECT. Every time it went to normal rectangle size, I realize how much empty space other movies have when it is in that ratio. Bring back the square movies, I don't need the white noise in the background.

The only part that I wish had more to it was the ending or maybe I just never wanted the movie to end.

There were moments I understood King Richard completely even when all was against him and then moments where I contemplated on whether his stubbornness (and maybe even envy) guided his choices before anything else.

The gangster subplot -yes, I think should have been there- After the first encounter with them, I felt uneasy every time the family went to the tennis courts after and that must have been their reality as well (the real Williams family).

This is the first time I've watched a movie and within the first few minutes, been stressed about what the budget must have been. 

That scene where someone is consoling Jack Conrad on his failed acting career. How the greatest gift that fame can give to an actor is not a long career but to have them seen even beyond their time. Not that they are idolized, beautified- but seen.

Then that ending... where Manny watches movie Nellie and sobs as he sees they are making fun of her; movie Nellie messes up her lines, is clumsy, has an ugly New Jersey accent. But then he smiles. By then, he realizes they both had accomplished exactly what they wanted: Nellie's death may just be a corner story in the newspaper but is still on the front page, people learn of who Nellie was on the screen even after she already died. Movies aren't meant to last forever and Manny is no longer a producer. 

Does anyone else think this movie was meta? It's saying how hollywood isn't meant to last forever.. while being a three hour hollywood movie! MAN! If that's not a forever time to sit in the theatre, then I'm afraid.

IF ANYONE INTERRUPTS THIS SCENE AGAIN, I WILL SHIT ON YOU. I WILL SHIT ON YOUR HEAD.","margot robbie, brad pitt, hlaoudi",2023-01-11
